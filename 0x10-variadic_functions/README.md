***Variadic Functions***
***The project has four tasks on variadic functions and application***
Task: 0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant
	This function will return the sum of all its parameters
	The prototype to this function is int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
	The function will return 0 if n ==0
Task: 1. To be is to be the value of a variable
	The task is a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line
	Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
