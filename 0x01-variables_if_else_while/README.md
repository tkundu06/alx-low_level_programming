***This project is going to cover various concepts starting with variables, if & else statements, and while loop***
	NB: Only the (putchar) function is allowed to display the result to the screen(output)
***0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing***
	1. The program is meant to assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
	2. The if & else statements are used to print whether number stored in the variable n is positive or negative
	3. The functions to be used in this program include rand, srand & RAND_MAX. 
***1. The last digit***
	1. program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
	2. The objective is to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n
	3. rand, srand & RAND_MAX functions will be used in this case 
***2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game***
	1. The objective of the program is to print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	2. The while loop is used in this program
m
***3. alphABET***
	1. Program to print letters of alphabet.
	2. The first objective is to print the letters of the alphabet in lowercase
	3. The second objective is to print letters of alphabet in upper case, then followed by a new line
***4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off***
	1. The objective for the C program is to print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	2. All the letters will be printed except 'q' & 'e'
***5. Numbers***
	1. The objective for the program is to print single digit numbers of base 10, starting from zero
	2. The objective will be achieved by using while loop to iterate from number 0 to 9
***6. Numberz***
	1. The goal of this program is to print single digit numbers of base 10 from 0
	2. The followed by a newline
	3. No variable of type char is allowed.
***7. Smile in the mirror***
	1. Printing the alphabet in lowercase and in reverse if the objective of the program
	2. The while loop is used to iterate between letters.
***8. Hexadecimal***
	1. The program prints all the hexadecimal(all number of base 16) in lowercase, followed by a new line
	2. NB: declaration of variable is done using int.
	3. Then, the (0x) will precede the number to indicate hexadecimal number
	4. The format specifier %x will print hexadecimal in lowercase
***9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success***
