i***This project is going to cover various concepts starting with variables, if & else statements, and while loop***

	1. The program is meant to assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
	2. The if & else statements are used to print whether number stored in the variable n is positive or negative
	3. The functions to be used in this program include rand, srand & RAND_MAX. 
***1. The last digit***
	1. program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
	2. The objective is to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n
	3. rand, srand & RAND_MAX functions will be used in this case 
***2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game***
	1. The objective of the program is to print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	2. The while loop is used in this program
